        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p><strong>Valorant</strong> is an objective based online multiplayer game where two teams of five players face each other in a series of rounds, 
           switching roles as defending and attacking teams around planting and defusing a bomb called the "spike", similar to the gameplay of Counter-Strike. 
           The first team to win thirteen rounds, wins the match. The game rewards precise accuracy and fast reflexes, team work and a tactical approach. The 
           defending team also wins the round if 100 seconds pass without a successful plant by the attacking team.</p>
