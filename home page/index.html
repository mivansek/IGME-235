    <p class="bodypara">My name is Matt Ivansek, and I am a second-year Game Design and Development student.
       My favorite games are Celeste, Metroid: Dread, and Valorant, and I also enjoy programming,
       acting, and anime. From this course, I hope to be able to make web games that I can easily 
       share with others. As for the degree as a whole, I hope to one day make games of all kinds
       from all the ideas that are brewing in my head as I write this.
